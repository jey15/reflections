When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I need to access my files from any system rather than my local system and make changes to it and commit it and simultaneously 
  maintain commit history as well, I will use remote repository rather than keeping all my work local. 

 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    When its done manualy we can govern when to commit when there is a logical change. If Git autoatically stays up-to-date with y remote repository, there might be chances it updates the repository when there is no logical change and there might be useless commits taking up the space.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork creates a copy of the repository on GitHub, directly on your own GitHub profile and the new commits will reflect on your new forked repository under your profile. 
		Clone can create a copy of the repository present remotely or on the same local machine, to your local system and the new commits will be saved in your own system. 
	Branches create new chain of commits which are accessible from one of its parent commit in the master branch existing in your repositories that can in your local machine or present remotely.

    When we need to copy a repository on GitHub directly to our own profile and make changes to it  we use forks instead of clones as cloning can do the same but in a long process of pull and push. When we are concerned with copying a repository to our own system we use clone. When we simply need to commit changes in a repository we use branch.

stored locally?
